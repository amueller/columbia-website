### Description
This class offers a hands-on approach to machine learning and data science. The
class discusses the application of machine learning methods like SVMs, Random
Forests, Gradient Boosting and neural networks on real world dataset, including
data preparation, model selection and evaluation. This class complements COMS
W4721 in that it relies entirely on available open source implementations in
scikit-learn and tensor flow for all implementations. Apart from applying
models, we will also discuss software development tools and practices relevant
to productionizing machine learning models.

### Prerequisites
Familiarity with Python programming and basic use of NumPy, pandas and matplotlib.

### Homework policy
All homework assignments are due at 4pm of the day posted. No later
submissions (or commits) will be accepted. There are no deadline extensions.
The last commit before the deadline will be counted as your submission. All
homework assignments must execute on the Travis continuous integration server
to ensure reproducibility. All code is expected to run on Python 3.4 and adhere
to the pep8 standard as enforced by the pep8 (or flake8) linter. All functions
must contain numpy-style docstrings.  Please note that there is only one week
to work on homework 4.

### Grading / course grade
5 homework assignments (60%), midterm exam (20%), final in-class exam (20%).
All homework assignments are programming assignments and need to be submitted
via Github (as will be explained in the class). The midterm will test material
from the first half of the class, while the second exam will test material from
the second half.

### Exams
The exams will be written, no computer or course material allowed.
Everything that is on the slides or on the notes to the slides is up for
testing.  There might be some minor coding, but mostly conceptual questions and
multiple choice.

The syntax of git and the python libraries that were covered in class (as far
as they were covered) will be content of the exam.
