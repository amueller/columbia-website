<h2>Projects</h2>
<h3>Scikit-learn</h3>
I spend a fair amount of time developing and maintaining [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/).
You can find issues that are of particular interest to me under [Andy's pets](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/projects/6). We are also
in the process of drafting a full roadmap including long-term and short-term goals for the project.

<h3>Automatic Machine Learning</h3>
My current research revolves around practical automatic machine learning. I'm also collaborating with the team of OpenMl.


<h3>dabl</h3>
My group recently launched [dabl](https://github.com/amueller/dabl/), a tool for quick data exploration and simple automatic machine learning.
