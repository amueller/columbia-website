<h3>Scikit-learn</h3>
I spend a fair amount of time developing and maintaining [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/).
You can find issues that are of particular interest to me under [Andy's pets](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/projects/6). We are also
in the process of drafting a full roadmap including long-term and short-term goals for the project.

<h3>Automatic Machine Learning</h3>
My current research revolves practical automatic machine learning.


<h3>Working with me</h3>
There are three ways to work with me: for course credit, as a research asssistant, or as an internship.
I will only consider applicants with substantial coursework in machine learning.
If you are interested in working with me on scikit-learn, a good way to get my attention
is to actually **contribute to scikit-learn by yourself**. There is an extensive guide
[in the scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/contributing.html#ways-to-contribute).
I would not recommend picking one of my pets from above, but rather easy issues as
recommended in the developers guide.
If you are not at Columbia and you don't have a personal recommendation from someone I know,
it's unlikely I will consider you for an internship unless you contributed to scikit-learn
or did research in automatic ML.
