<h3>Working with me</h3>
There are three ways to work with me: for course credit, as a research asssistant, or as an internship.
I will only consider applicants with substantial coursework in machine learning.

If you are interested in working with me on scikit-learn, a good way to get my attention
is to actually **contribute to scikit-learn by yourself**. There is an extensive guide
[in the scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/contributing.html#ways-to-contribute).
I would recommend starting with easy issues as recommended in the developers guide.

If you are not at Columbia and you don't have a personal recommendation from someone I know,
it's unlikely I will consider you for an internship unless you contributed to scikit-learn
or did research in automatic ML.
