<h3>Enrolling in COMS W4995 Applied Machine Learning 2019</h3>
<p>
MS DS students can enroll in COMS W4995 via SSOL. External students have to follow the <a href="http://datascience.columbia.edu/course-inventory">
Cross-Registration Instructions</a> outlined by DSI.
</p>
<b>The class is listed as "Deep Learning" in SSOL by mistake. I will teach Applied Machine Learning, as in 2018.</b>
