### Enrollment
MS DS students can enroll via SSOL. External students need to follow the <a href="http://datascience.columbia.edu/course-inventory">
Cross-Registration Instructions</a> provided by DSI.

### Description
This class offers a hands-on approach to machine learning and data science. The
class discusses the application of machine learning methods like SVMs, Random
Forests, Gradient Boosting and neural networks on real world dataset, including
data preparation, model selection and evaluation. This class complements COMS
W4721 in that it relies entirely on available open source implementations in
scikit-learn and tensor flow for all implementations. Apart from applying
models, we will also discuss software development tools and practices relevant
to productionizing machine learning models.

### Prerequisites
Familiarity with Python programming and basic use of NumPy, pandas and matplotlib.
A good reference is the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook)
by Jake VanderPlas. It's online for free and available as a notebook at the link above.
I highly recommend going through it before starting the class.

### Grading / course grade
6 homework assignments (60%), midterm exam (20%), final in-class exam (20%).
All homework assignments are programming assignments and need to be submitted
via Github (as will be explained in the class). The midterm will test material
from the first half of the class, while the second exam will test material from
the second half.

### Homework policy
All homework assignments are due at 1pm. No later submissions (or commits) will
be accepted. There are no deadline extensions. The last commit before the
deadline will be counted as your submission. 
All code is expected to run on Python 3.4 and adhere to the pep8 standard.

### Exams
The exams will be written, no computer or course material allowed.
Everything that is on the slides or on the notes to the slides is up for
testing.  There might be some minor coding, but mostly conceptual questions and
multiple choice.

The syntax of git and the python libraries that were covered in class (as far
as they were covered) will be content of the exam.


## Academic rules of conduct
You are expected to adhere to the [Academic Honesty policy](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/education/honesty/) of the Computer Science Department, as well as the following course-specific policies.

### Collaboration
You are welcome and encouraged to discuss course materials and reading assignments with other students.
Please limit discussion of homework to general approaches. You are not allowed to share
code between submissions or submission groups.
For homeworks submitted individually, each individual is required to write their own solution.
For homeworks submitted in groups (if allowed), a single write-up should be submitted.
Collaboration is not permitted for any of the exams.

### Use of outside references
Students are welcome to use any outside materials sources on general machine
learning and data science topics.  However, you are not permitted to use
solutions to specific homework tasks or problems that you find online.
Code that is provided during the lectures or as part of the github repository
can be reused for the homework, but should be marked as such.

### Violations
Violation of any portion of these policies will result in a penalty to be
assessed at the instructor’s discretion. **This may include receiving a zero
grade for the assignment in question AND a failing grade for the whole course,
even for the first infraction.** Such students are also reported to the
relevant Deans’ offices that handle cases of academic dishonesty.

### Copyright notice
Lecture slides, notes, illustrations and notebooks are licensed under
[CC-0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) and can
be used without requiring acknowledgement for any purpose (though
acknowledgement is appreciated).  Homeworks, homework solutions, exams and exam
